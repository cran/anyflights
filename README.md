The `anyflights` package supplies a set of functions to query air travel
data similar to those found in
[`nycflights13`](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13). With a
user-defined year and airport, the `anyflights` function will grab data
on:

  - `flights`: all flights that departed a given airport in a given year
    and month
  - `weather`: hourly meterological data for a given airport in a given
    year and month
  - `airports`: airport names, FAA codes, and locations
  - `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier (airline) codes
    and names
  - `planes`: construction information about each plane found in
    `flights`

The package also exports a set of functions to query each of the above
datasets individually. Each of the functions are named `get_*` followed
with the names of the datasets (shown above in `code`), and require a
varying combination of the `station` (character vector of FAA LID
airport codes), `year` (as an integer), and `month` (integer vector)
arguments. Optionally, the user can also supply a `dir` argument
(filepath to a folder) to save the resulting datasets.

These functions require a *strong* connection to run; expect several
minutes of runtime, especially for the `anyflights` and `get_flights`
functions.

The FAA usually posts all of the data for a given year during February
or March of the following year. All airports with an FAA LID code are
supported, to my knowledge.

### Installation

-----

`anyflights` can be installed with the following code:

``` r
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("simonpcouch/anyflights")
```

### Basic Usage

-----

To grab a named list of 5 dataframes giving `nycflights13`-like air
travel data for the Portland International Airport during June 2019, you
could call:

``` r
pdxflights19 <- anyflights("PDX", 2019, 6)
```

To grab the original `nycflights13` datasets, try:

``` r
nycflights13_ <- anyflights(c("JFK", "LGA", "EWR"), 2013)
```

The package also provides an `as_flights_package` function to create a
data-only package from the data outputted by `anyflights`. To create the
package from the data, just supply a name:

``` r
pdxflights19 %>%
  as_flights_package("pdxflights")
```

and check out the data-only package in the `pdxflights` directory\! üêõ
